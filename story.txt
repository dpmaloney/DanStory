Old McDonald had a farm. On this farm he had many animals. One day he decided that he should sell some of his animals.
He knew how happy his animals made him, and he wanted to share the happiness with others. One day, a little girl came to his farm with her parents, and she asked Old McDonald if he would sell her family his horse. 
Old Mcdonald remembered back to his childhood when he got his first horse. He wanted this little girl to learn to love animals the way he did. He told the little girl that he would sell them his horse and he offered to teach the little girl how to ride as well.
